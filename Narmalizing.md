Let's analyze the functional dependencies in the provided schema:

1. Patients Table:
   - Functional Dependencies:
     - PatientId → PatientName, Age, DOB, Weight, Height
   - There are no violations of BCNF in the Patients table. All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

2. Doctor Table:
   - Functional Dependencies:
     - BMDCRegNumber → DoctorName, Specialist, Qualification, NumberOfPatients, Ratings, Experience
   - There are no violations of BCNF in the Doctor table. All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

3. Appointment Table:
   - Functional Dependencies:
     - SerialNumber → Date, Time, PatientName, PatientId, DoctorId
   - There are no violations of BCNF in the Appointment table. All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

4. Status Table:
   - Functional Dependencies:
     - SerialNumber → Schedule, Date, Time, DoctorId
   - There are no violations of BCNF in the Status table. All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

Since there are no violations of BCNF in the provided schema, there is no need to further normalize the database. All tables are already in BCNF, ensuring that there are no non-trivial functional dependencies that violate BCNF rules. Therefore, the normalized schema diagram would be the same as the provided schema.
